# EC601_Project2
Repository for EC601 Project2 in which I explore uses of the Twitter API and Google NLP API

## Contents
### Google NLP
Provides a few simple test cases for using the Google NLP API, including:
#### NLP_cl.py
A simple program which allows a user to enter input via the command line and view the resulting sentiment analysis (sentiment score and magnitude) of the input
#### NLP_txt.py
A program which allows users to upload a .txt file and perform sentiment analysis on the document. The program also allows users to optionally also perform sentiment analysis on each line in the file
